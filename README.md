## My Node.JS Projects

### Project 3

Developed a Node.js application deployed on Google Cloud Run to monitor incoming files from a vendor's source into designated GCS buckets.

- Implemented functionality to automatically scan each incoming file for viruses using an industry-standard antivirus library.
- Utilized Google Cloud Storage triggers to initiate file processing upon new file uploads, ensuring real-time monitoring and efficient handling of incoming data.
- Integrated logic to segregate files based on their scan results, moving clean files to a designated GCS bucket for further processing and quarantining infected files to a secure quarantine GCS bucket.
- Employed best practices in cloud architecture and serverless computing to ensure scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the solution.

### Project 2

Developed and deployed multiple Node.js RESTful APIs to GCP

- Developed and deployed multiple Node.js RESTful APIs on Google Cloud Platform.
- Programmed APIs using Visual Studio Code, ensuring efficient and maintainable code.
- Utilized Redis as an in-memory data store to enhance application performance.
- Designed and documented API endpoints, ensuring clear communication with stakeholders.
- Implemented mock APIs during development and testing phases to remove dependencies and streamline workflows.
- Leveraged Postman for API development, testing, automation, and learning.
- Automated deployment to GCP Kubernetes cluster using Helm, Spinnaker, GitHub Actions, Skaffold, Jenkins, Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, and triggers.
- Managed blue-green deployments and auto-scaling with Kubernetes and YAML configurations.
- Collaborated closely with vendors and other teams to ensure seamless coordination of upstream and downstream APIs during releases.
- Onboarded new APIs to Kong gateway for improved API management and security.
- Conducted troubleshooting and root cause analysis for application support issues.
- Created JMeter projects to automate performance testing and identify bottlenecks.
- Implemented Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and automated testing using Cucumber, Jest, Spinnaker, GitHub Actions, and Cloud Build.
- Defined policies and metrics in GCP to monitor API behaviors and performance, ensuring optimal service delivery.

### Project 1

Designed a Full Stack web app on AWS

- Spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge web application leveraging modern technologies including React, TypeScript, Material UI, Bootstrap, React Router, i18n, axios, formik, lodash, and S3 for frontend implementation.
- Architected and programmed backend services using Node.js JavaScript, harnessing the power of AWS Lambda functions, Amazon API Gateway, and Aurora PostgreSQL database, ensuring robustness, scalability, and high performance.
- Engineered Node.js backend components, including RESTful APIs, middleware, authentication mechanisms, and database interactions, employing TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.
- Integrated third-party services and APIs seamlessly into the application architecture, orchestrating communication between frontend and backend systems for smooth data flow and functionality.
- Implemented server-side logic to handle complex business requirements, data processing, and validation, optimizing application performance and user experience.
- Designed and executed database schemas, queries, and optimizations in Aurora PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient storage and retrieval.
  Orchestrated deployment and management of backend services on AWS infrastructure, including configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting, leveraging AWS CloudFormation and other automation tools.
